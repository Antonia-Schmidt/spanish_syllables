In this paper we saw that stressed and unstressed syllables in Spanish slightly differ in their temporal organization. Stressed syllables are significantly longer than unstressed syllables, and their temporal organization shows more variation than in unstressed syllables. In contrast to unstressed syllables, stressed syllables do not uniformly show the same expected behavior of globally organized syllable onset clusters.\\
Whether these differences will hold when tested about statistical significance is a task for the future when more data can be included into the analysis. An analysis of the interaction of nucleus vowel and stress on the RSDs of could be promising. Furthermore more research can be done with respect to the effect of stress on the temporal relations on the timing between the consonants in CC-clusters, i.e. the interplateau interval (IPI).
