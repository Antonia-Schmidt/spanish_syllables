Depending on stress: how are the timing relations between articulatory gestures in Spanish?

This repository contains the work for a project on the effects of stress on syllable intern timing relations in Spanish. It contains the computational notebook illustrating the data analysis and the report introducing the problem and methodology. The repository structure follows Figueiredo et al. (2022) suggestion for how to use computational notebooks in research, but the "results" folder with the subfolder "data" can not be made public due to privacy reasons. 
The code is adapted for the single use case of having one datasheet for each participant and all data cleaning is specific to this data.
